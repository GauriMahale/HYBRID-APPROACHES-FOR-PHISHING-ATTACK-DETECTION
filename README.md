# üõ°Ô∏è HYBRID APPROACH FOR PHISHING ATTACK DETECTION

## üìå Introduction

Phishing attacks pose a major threat to cybersecurity, yet detecting them is challenging due to their evolving tactics and high false positive rates.

To address these limitations, we propose a **hybrid phishing attack detection system** that combines the strengths of:

- ‚úÖ Rule-based systems
- ‚úÖ Machine Learning (ML)
- ‚úÖ Deep Learning (DL)

Our system is evaluated on a real-world phishing URL dataset and has achieved **high accuracy** with **low false positives**. It is designed to detect even new and unknown phishing attempts **in real-time**, providing robust protection of users' personal and financial data.

## üéØ Objective

- Develop a **hybrid detection system** integrating rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning methods.
- Detect new and unknown phishing attacks **in real-time**.
- Reduce false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy.
- Protect users' **privacy, credentials, and financial data** from evolving phishing threats.

## üîç Methodology

The proposed system operates in three main phases:

1. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Load and clean phishing datasets using `pandas`.
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Extract relevant features from URLs and HTML content.
3. **Classification** ‚Äì Apply and compare multiple ML & DL models.

### Machine Learning Models Used:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- **Ensemble Voting Classifier**

### Tech Stack:
- Python (pandas, sklearn, keras, Flask)
- Flask (for web deployment)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for metrics visualization)
